# NFL Projection Model

This project provides an NFL projection model that leverages player projections, DVOA (Defense-adjusted Value Over Average) statistics, and various other factors to generate game-by-game analyses, betting edges, and recommendations.

## Features

* **Player Projections:**  Incorporates player projections for various positions (QB, RB, WR, TE) to estimate individual performance.
* **DVOA Analysis:**  Utilizes DVOA data to assess team and player performance relative to league average.
* **Matchup Processing:**  Analyzes individual matchups, considering factors like weather, home-field advantage, and offensive/defensive strengths.
* **Betting Insights:**  Calculates projected scores, win probabilities, and betting edges for moneyline, spread, and total bets.
* **Detailed Game Analysis:**  Provides a comprehensive breakdown of each game, including player lineups, DVOA comparisons, and betting recommendations.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone [https://github.com/](https://github.com/)<your-username>/nfl_projection_model.git
   cd nfl_projection_model
   ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment:**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt   
    ```

4. **Prepare Your Data:**
* Place your raw data files in the data/raw/ directory, following the structure outlined in the project.
* Update the file paths in config.py to match your data locations.

5. **Run the Model:**
    ```bash
    python src/main.py
    ```

## Project Structure
